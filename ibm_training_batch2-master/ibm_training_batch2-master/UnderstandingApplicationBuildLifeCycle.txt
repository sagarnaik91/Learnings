Phases of Application Developement
1.Downloading 3 rd party libs
	3 rd party classes are those which does not come along with Java environment
	Now these 3 rd party classes get implemented,compiled and packaged inside the java libs(i.e. .jar files)
	And these jar files are shared with the developers.
	These 3 rd party libs are made available on central repositories like mvnrepository.com


	If application developement needs classes apart from the ones available with Java

2.	Building CLASSPATH of the project by setting the location where 3 rd party libs are downloaded
	in -CP command

3.	Implementation of code

4.	Compile the code.During this compile phase compiler will use CLASSPATH set to find unresolved/unknown
	symbols

5.	Unit testing.

6.	Packaging i.e. creating package(.jar file for library app,.war file for WebApplication e.g.)

7.	Deploying the app 	

Maven is a build tool which assists developer to automate each and every build lifecycle phase.
Maven has CLI(Command-line interface)

GroupID: Usually indicates Developer/owner of project.It should be unique across the artifact repo.
ArtifactID: Name of the project.It should be unique under the particular GroupID
Version:A particular released version.It should be unique for particular project

Build life cycle phases and their order:
1.Clean:Which cleans all previously generated compiled files as well as package files and allows to run
fresh build lifecycle.
2.Download resources(i.e. dependencies):In this phase all project's dependencies would be downloaded from
artifact repository like mvnrepository.com.Resources maven plugin downloads project dependencies along with their circular 
dependencies.It by default downloads the dependencies at C:\Users\<Current User>\.m2\repository.
It creates directory structure according to GroupID,ArtificatID and version of dependency and jar file
would be downloaded there in.And it builds the CLASSPATH of the project.
We can change the default location of LocalRepository from C:\Users\<Current User>\.m2\repository to any
other location of our choice by creating settings.xml inside C:\Users\<Current User>\.m2
Settings.xml should mention a desired local repository location in <localRepository> tag
e.g.
<settings>
		gs>
3.Compilation of code:Maven uses compiler plugin which internally uses javac(a java compiler) to compile
the source code of our application.Compiler plugin compiles all .java files from src/main/java which
is default location to find the sources of an application.
This compiler plugin takes java files as input and produces .class files as an output of this
compilation phase.Compilation phase creates .class files for application,inside ProjectDIR/target/classes folder
And .class files for Unit testcases would be created inside ProjectDIR/target/test-classes

4.Unit Testing:
First mvn compile:test-compile phase compiles Unit test code from src/test/java and puts the created class files inside
ProjectDIR/target/test-classes folder
Sure-fire plugin takes care of triggering unit testcases.

5.Package phase:jar plugin for maven bundles application's compiled files(i.e. .class files created
inside PROJECT_DIR/target/classes folder) in .jar file.This jar file gets created in target folder
6.Release Phase:
	Installing created jar file in Maven's local repository using maven's maven-install-plugin
	Deploying created jar file in Central artifact repository like mvnrepository.com from where
	it can be downloaded and used by developers.
