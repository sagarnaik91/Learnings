In order to run selenium scripts on a remote machine we need following things on remote machine:
1. selenium-server-standalone.jar 
2. chromedriver.exe
3. chrome browser
Then we need to run following command and start server:
java -jar D:\IBMTraining_2\selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=D:\\IBMTraining_2\\Drivers\\chromedriver.exe -host 192.168.0.103 -port 4724

In script we need to do following changes:
We need create a DesiredCapability to define session properties.
In desiredcapability object we need to set "browserName" capability with the name of a browser on 
which we want to run our tests on.
If we want to run tests on Chrome we will set browserName to chrome.

DesiredCapabilities Cap=new DesiredCapabilities();
Cap.setCapability("browserName", "chrome");

Then we need to call constructor of RemoteWebDriver with 2 arguments:
1. URL of a server(IPAddress:Port)
2. DesiredCapability object having all session properties.

D=new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://192.168.0.101:4724/wd/hub"),Cap);

Appium Session establishment:
While establishing Appium session, server performs following activities:
1. It checks if an application is already installed on the device.If yes then it uninstalls that
app, if we have set FullReset to true.
2. It installs the application apk on the device : server used adb install <path of the apk>
and for this server needs path of the .apk file
3. It launches the app on the device: For launching the app server uses adb shell am start <packagename>/<activityname>
server needs package name and launchable activity name	

Using desired capabilities we can provide these settings to the server and server will use these
settings and run the commands to perform required activities(installation/launching) while session
establishment.
